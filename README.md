# Brain Tumor MRI Classification with RESNet and Area Attention

This project implements a **RESNet-based convolutional neural network** with **Area Attention** to classify MRI images of brain tumors. We trained and validated our model on the MRI images from the dataset available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/murtozalikhon/brain-tumor-multimodal-image-ct-and-mri).

## üìå Model Overview

We used a **RESNet-inspired architecture** with residual blocks and **Area Attention layers** to enhance feature extraction. Our architecture consists of:
- A **stem convolutional layer** to preprocess input images.
- Multiple **CNN blocks with residual connections** for feature extraction.
- **Area Attention layers** to focus on important regions.
- **Downsampling layers** to reduce spatial dimensions.
- A **global average pooling layer** followed by a fully connected layer for classification.

## üöÄ Training Details

- **Dataset**: MRI images from the Kaggle dataset.
- **Image size**: Resized to **224x224**.
- **Normalization**: Mean and std set to `[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]`.
- **Optimizer**: Adam with **learning rate = 0.001**.
- **Loss function**: Binary Cross-Entropy with Logits.
- **Training-validation split**: 80%-20%.
- **Batch size**: 16.
- **Number of epochs**: 10.

## üéØ Results

We achieved the following validation performance:
```
Validation Loss: 0.1357, Accuracy: 96.10%
```

## üìä Model Evaluation

To evaluate the model, we used:
- **Training & Validation Loss/Accuracy Plots**.
- **Confusion Matrix** to analyze classification performance.
- **Classification Report** with precision, recall, and F1-score.
